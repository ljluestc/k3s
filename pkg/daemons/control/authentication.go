// Improve token validation to handle cases where nodes have been removed
// Implementation would include:
// 1. Check if the token belongs to a node that still exists in the cluster
// 2. If the node doesn't exist, invalidate the token instead of logging errors
// 3. Add rate limiting for auth error logs to prevent flooding
// 4. Add context awareness to distinguish between normal auth failures and removed node cases
